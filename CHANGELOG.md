# Changelog

Retroactive alpha release history for shipped Specrew features. `.specrew\config.yml`
is the canonical source for the active version; this file records the feature
baseline that each release number represents.

## Unreleased

- Added `proposals/` surface as Specrew's public design pipeline. Initial
  promotion: 29 numbered proposals plus supporting README, INDEX, and
  template, ranging from shipped features (001-007) to draft features
  (008-012) to candidate ideas (013-029). Pattern follows Rust RFCs, Python
  PEPs, and TC39 proposals. A future "Public Proposals Surface" feature
  (Proposal 028) will harden the lifecycle integration with soft validators
  and auto status transitions.
- Pruned stale Recent Changes entry for 014-handoff-format-scoping in
  `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to keep the rolling window at the two
  most recent features.
