.SYNOPSIS
  Resolve a feature ref against project-local metadata and git merged-status.
.DESCRIPTION
  Resource accessor (IDesign): reads the feature's project-local presence (specs/<ref>/) and
  corroborates "not resumable" with git merged-status (data-storage d3). The feature ref is
  always re-resolved against the current project root - the committed absolute path is never
  trusted (FR-015). Git calls fail safe (a failure means "not provably merged", never a false
  clear). Feature 174 (FR-014, FR-015). Active-features registry + closeout-artifact signals
  are layered in later; presence + merged-status is the iteration-001 floor.
