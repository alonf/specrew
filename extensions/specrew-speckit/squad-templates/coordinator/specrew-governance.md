## Formal Spec-Kit + Specrew Lifecycle

These rules override generic Squad coordination whenever the repository is bootstrapped for both Spec Kit and Specrew (for example, `.specify/workflows/speckit/workflow.yml` and `.specrew/config.yml` both exist).

1. **Default to the formal lifecycle**
   - Treat Spec-Kit + Specrew as the default delivery path for feature work and requirement changes.
   - Route the work through the canonical sequence: `speckit.specify` -> explicit clarify decision -> `speckit.specrew-speckit.before-plan` -> `speckit.plan` -> `speckit.tasks` -> `speckit.specrew-speckit.after-tasks` -> `speckit.specrew-speckit.before-implement` -> `speckit.implement`.
   - After `speckit.specify`, either run `speckit.clarify` or record a concrete skip rationale before planning. Do not silently skip the clarify gate.
   - For new-feature and brownfield-new work, default to `speckit.clarify` unless the current spec is already materially complete for planning.
   - When those dedicated Speckit agents or commands are available, use them instead of jumping straight to generic planning or coding agents.

2. **No direct idea-to-code bypass**
   - Do NOT route a new feature, requirement change, or scoped product work directly from a user request, PRD, or issue into implementation.
   - The only allowed exceptions are:
     1. the work is clearly a small fix inside an already-active `specs/<feature>/` directory and current iteration
     2. the user explicitly instructs you to bypass the formal lifecycle
   - If you bypass it, say so plainly and do not describe the run as Spec-Kit/Specrew compliant.

3. **Artifact contract is mandatory**
   - Spec Kit feature artifacts: `specs/<feature>/spec.md`, `specs/<feature>/plan.md`, `specs/<feature>/tasks.md`
   - Specrew iteration artifacts: `specs/<feature>/iterations/<NNN>/plan.md`, `state.md`, `drift-log.md`, `review.md`, `retro.md`
   - Do not claim a phase has started or completed unless the corresponding artifact exists and is current.

4. **Scaffold missing lifecycle artifacts before continuing**
   - When planning begins without an iteration plan, scaffold `iterations/<NNN>/plan.md`.
   - When execution begins without state tracking, scaffold `state.md` and `drift-log.md`.
   - When review or retrospective begins without artifacts, scaffold `review.md` or `retro.md`.
   - Use the installed Specrew helpers: `scaffold-iteration-plan.ps1`, `scaffold-iteration-artifacts.ps1`, `scaffold-review-artifact.ps1`, and `scaffold-retro-artifact.ps1`.

5. **Gate phase transitions**
   - Run `validate-governance.ps1` before moving from planning -> execution, execution -> review, and review -> retrospective when iteration artifacts are present.
   - A failed governance check blocks the transition; do not work around it with a narrative summary.

6. **Process-claim discipline**
   - Only say the team followed Spec-Kit or Specrew end-to-end when the work was actually routed through the canonical lifecycle and the artifact chain exists on disk.
   - Otherwise describe the result accurately as Squad-driven work informed by Specrew governance, or as an explicit process bypass.

7. **Handoff discipline**
   - Every spawned agent working inside the lifecycle must receive the active feature directory, iteration directory, requirement references, and relevant artifact paths.
   - No agent should infer which spec or iteration governs the work from branch names or memory alone.

8. **Persist repair escalation state**
   - When the same artifact keeps failing a governance gate, record the active repair escalation in `iterations/<NNN>/state.md` by using `manage-escalation-state.ps1`.
   - After every escalation activation or resolution, run `sync-squad-model-overrides.ps1 -IterationDirectory <active-iteration>` so `.squad/config.json` reflects the current escalation tier immediately.
   - Each repeated failure must increment the stored failure count, lock out the previous repair owner for that artifact, and escalate the reasoning tier from `balanced` to `deep` when warranted.
   - On resume, treat an active repair escalation as the highest-priority recovery step before normal task execution.
   - As soon as the gate passes, resolve the stored escalation so the temporary owner override clears and the default `efficiency` tier is restored for subsequent work.

9. **Preserve Specrew-managed rosters**
   - If `.squad/team.md` contains a Specrew-managed baseline roster, treat it as operational state rather than generic Squad bootstrap state.
   - Do NOT enter generic team-setup or recast mode while that managed roster exists.
   - Preserve both baseline roles and any supplemental members already recorded in the project roster.

10. **Honor delegated routing plans**
   - When Specrew provides an effective delegated routing plan for lifecycle roles, use that plan for planning, implementation, review, spec-governance, and repair work unless the human explicitly overrides it.
   - Materialize that plan into `.squad/config.json` via `agentModelOverrides`, and re-read the config before each lifecycle or repair spawn rather than caching it once at session start.
   - If a requested delegated assignment cannot be honored at runtime, append a short dated entry to `.squad/decisions.md` with the role or work item, requested agent, actual agent, and fallback reason.
   - Keep Reviewer and Spec Steward independent from the Implementer whenever multiple enabled agents make that possible.

11. **Escalate live model tiers**
   - On repeated governance-gate failures, update `.squad/config.json` so the current repair owner moves from the fast tier to a balanced tier, then to a deep tier if the next repair still fails.
   - Clear any temporary escalation override as soon as the gate passes so normal routing resumes.
