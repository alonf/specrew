# Coverage Evidence: Iteration 009 — Review Candidate Fidelity

**Schema**: v1
**Reviewed**:
**Overall Verdict**:

> **⚠️ Review Evidence Warning** _(Form-vs-Meaning Gap Detected)_
>
> This iteration's task tracking declares **7 completed task(s)**, but the git diff against baseline `afb3eda731d35ae922e92d9acf200f80e32e9580` contains **84 file(s)**.
>
> **Severity**: WARNING  
> **Implication**: Review evidence may be incomplete or misleading.
>
> **Possible causes**:
>
> - Implementation work was not committed before scaffolding review artifacts
> - Task status markers in plan.md or review.md do not match actual progress
> - Baseline reference in state.md is stale or incorrect
>
> **Remediation**:
>
> 1. Verify implementation is committed: `git diff afb3eda731d35ae922e92d9acf200f80e32e9580...HEAD --stat`
> 2. If uncommitted work exists: `git add . && git commit -m "Implementation complete"`
> 3. Re-run scaffolder with `-Force` flag to regenerate review artifacts after commit
> 4. Re-run `validate-governance.ps1` to clear pre-review commit gate error
>
> _See Proposal 073 (Review Evidence Integrity) for background on this validation._

## Test Strategy

- Implementation briefing: (unavailable)
- Review-time strategy: use `reviewer.test_commands` when configured; otherwise record `not_executed` explicitly and keep the signal visible in closeout output.

## Tests Run

| Command | Result | Pass Count | Fail Count | Duration | Exit Code | Notes |
| ------- | ------ | ---------- | ---------- | -------- | --------- | ----- |
| & '.\\tests\\integration\\quality-profile-foundation.ps1' | pass | 1 | 0 | 00:00:02.9975222 | 0 | PASS: Quality profile foundation scaffold and Phase 1/Phase 2 planning contracts expose versioned quality assets, bounded hardening metadata, preserve local overrides, and define recognized-stack/custom-composition expectations |
| & '.\\tests\\integration\\mechanical-findings-contract.ps1' | pass | 1 | 0 | 00:00:00.5164409 | 0 | PASS: Mechanical findings contract fixtures keep the Phase 1 rule set schema-compliant and make demoted rules remain visible with disposition references |
| & '.\\tests\\integration\\quality-evidence-governance.ps1' | pass | 1 | 0 | 00:00:12.1023422 | 0 | PASS: Quality evidence governance regressions passed. |
| & '.\\tests\\integration\\process-quality-scorer.ps1' | pass | 1 | 0 | 00:00:00.9937332 | 0 | PASS: Process scorer returns structured artifact and phase adherence results |
