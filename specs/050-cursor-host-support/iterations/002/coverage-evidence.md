# Coverage Evidence: Iteration 002

**Schema**: v1
**Reviewed**: 2026-05-29
**Overall Verdict**: accepted

> **Review Evidence Disposition** _(Form-vs-Meaning heuristic — DISPOSITIONED, not a gap)_
>
> The heuristic flags **3 completed task(s)** vs **10 file(s)** in the iter-002 baseline→HEAD diff.
> Expected over-delivery, NOT a gap: the 3 tasks deliver 3 test files (host-cursor / host-cursor-launch /
> host-detection-ux), and the remaining ~7 are iteration-002 governance artifacts (plan/state/drift-log/
> quality + reviewer artifacts). All 3 tasks committed (d53f6a4e) with green tests; no uncommitted work.

## Test Strategy

- Implementation briefing: (unavailable)
- Review-time strategy: use `reviewer.test_commands` when configured; otherwise record `not_executed` explicitly and keep the signal visible in closeout output.

## Tests Run

| Command | Result | Pass Count | Fail Count | Duration | Exit Code | Notes |
| ------- | ------ | ---------- | ---------- | -------- | --------- | ----- |
| & '.\\tests\\integration\\quality-profile-foundation.ps1' | pass | 1 | 0 | 00:00:02.6903408 | 0 | PASS: Quality profile foundation scaffold and Phase 1/Phase 2 planning contracts expose versioned quality assets, bounded hardening metadata, preserve local overrides, and define recognized-stack/custom-composition expectations |
| & '.\\tests\\integration\\mechanical-findings-contract.ps1' | pass | 1 | 0 | 00:00:00.9051427 | 0 | PASS: Mechanical findings contract fixtures keep the Phase 1 rule set schema-compliant and make demoted rules remain visible with disposition references |
| & '.\\tests\\integration\\quality-evidence-governance.ps1' | pass | 1 | 0 | 00:00:21.4091895 | 0 | PASS: Quality evidence governance regressions passed. |
| & '.\\tests\\integration\\process-quality-scorer.ps1' | pass | 1 | 0 | 00:00:01.6461246 | 0 | PASS: Process scorer returns structured artifact and phase adherence results |
