# Drift Log: Iteration 001

**Schema**: v1

<!--
  Markdown authoring note (Specrew lifecycle convention):

  When you add new drift events to this file, watch for MD032 (blanks-around-lists).
  A sentence ending with a colon, immediately followed by a bullet list, is the most
  common violation. Always put a BLANK LINE between the colon line and the list:

      BAD:                              GOOD:
      Resolution steps:                 Resolution steps:
      - Step one                        <— blank line here
      - Step two                        - Step one
                                        - Step two

  The F-033 pre-boundary markdownlint gate runs markdownlint-cli --fix on .md
  changes before every boundary-sync write, so most violations auto-fix — but the
  blank line you write in the first place avoids the cleanup churn.

## Summary

**Total drift events**: 0
**Resolution rate**: 100% (0/0 resolved)
**Specification drift**: None detected

## Events

No specification drift detected during Iteration 001 execution to date.

### T006 Review Checkpoint

- Compared T001-T006 output against FR-001-FR-004, FR-011-FR-012, FR-019,
  SC-002-SC-004, SC-008, SC-010, and SC-012.
- No required behavior was omitted, no unauthorized capability was added, and
  no documented deferral was contradicted.
- Review-time line-ending and cross-platform fixture repairs were required to
  satisfy FR-002 and FR-019; they are requirement-conforming rework, not drift.
- T007 and later tasks remain unauthorized and absent from the implementation
  diff.

### Resolution Strategies (Unused)

The following resolution strategies remain available if drift is detected later in execution:

- **spec-updated**: Update the spec to reflect implementation choice
- **implementation-reverted**: Revert implementation to match spec
- **deferred**: Mark drift as deferred to next iteration
- **human-decision**: Escalate to Alon for resolution

### Notes

- This artifact was scaffolded before review starts so drift can be logged immediately when detected.
- Replace the zero-drift summary with real counts when the first drift event is recorded.
