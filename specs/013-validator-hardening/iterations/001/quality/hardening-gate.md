## Concern Review

| Concern | Category | Status | Evidence Basis | Runtime Evidence Status | Expected Controls | Blocking | Rationale | Approval |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `security-surface` | `security` | `not-applicable` | `not-applicable` | `not-needed` | Reuse the existing repo-root path resolution and local-file-only validator model; do not add any network, auth, or privilege-changing behavior. | `false` | Iteration 001 modifies only repository-local validator parsing, reporting, contracts, and fixture coverage. No new trust boundary, credential flow, or external input path is introduced beyond the existing project-root resolution already in use. | — |
| `error-handling-expectations` | `error-handling` | `addressed` | `planning-time-analysis` | `pending-post-implementation` | T003 must wrap parse failures, missing files, schema deviations, and unexpected conditions in structured FAIL output with file path, line number when known, category, message, remediation hint, and non-zero exit behavior. | `false` | Planning evidence: graceful structured error reporting is one of the iteration's primary delivery goals, and the approved task slice already binds malformed, missing-file, and schema-deviation handling to the shared validator foundation before any rule-specific work proceeds. | — |
| `retry-idempotency-requirements` | `retry-idempotency` | `not-applicable` | `not-applicable` | `not-needed` | Keep the validator read-only and stateless so repeated runs against the same tree produce the same result set without side effects. | `false` | Iteration 001 introduces no write path, no external calls, and no retry orchestration. Re-running the validator is expected to be idempotent by construction because the feature only evaluates tracked files and emits structured results. | — |
| `test-integrity-targets` | `test-integrity` | `addressed` | `planning-time-analysis` | `pending-post-implementation` | T004 and T006-T013 must provide violating and compliant fixtures, scaffold/replay-path assertions, and reviewer-recorded evidence for both canonical-schema and canonical-concern rules. | `false` | Planning evidence: the approved iteration slice includes the harness, fixture, assertion, implementation, and reviewer-proof tasks needed to prove both new rules through deterministic replay rather than ad hoc spot checks. | — |
| `operational-resilience-concerns` | `operational` | `addressed` | `planning-time-analysis` | `pending-post-implementation` | Preserve current `validate-governance.ps1` arguments, PASS/FAIL formatting, exit-code behavior, and grandfathering expectations while adding the new rules. | `false` | Planning evidence: this slice hardens validator behavior but keeps the existing entrypoint and rollout assumptions intact, so operational resilience centers on additive behavior rather than new runtime dependencies. | — |
| `canonical-schema-rule-correctness` | `validation` | `addressed` | `planning-time-analysis` | `pending-post-implementation` | T006-T009 must prove the eight-field canonical header, missing-field enumeration, non-canonical-label detection, extra-narrative tolerance, and grandfathered-iteration exemptions against the actual validator surface. | `true` | Planning evidence: the triggering failure for this feature line was a validator crash on non-canonical iteration metadata, so iteration 001 explicitly binds contract alignment, fixtures, assertions, implementation, and reviewer proof to the schema rule before any closeout claim is possible. | — |
| `graceful-error-reporting-completeness` | `error-reporting` | `addressed` | `planning-time-analysis` | `pending-post-implementation` | T003 and T004 must cover malformed input, empty values, and missing files so every failure mode stays within structured FAIL output and no raw PowerShell exception reaches the user. | `true` | Planning evidence: FR-005 is central to this slice, and the planned foundation requires shared exception-wrapping helpers plus replay-path assertions that validate user-visible FAIL output rather than only internal helper behavior. | — |
| `validator-cli-surface-stability` | `compatibility` | `addressed` | `planning-time-analysis` | `pending-post-implementation` | T001, T003, T009, and T013 must show that arguments, defaults, PASS/FAIL formatting, and exit-code expectations remain additive while the new rules land. | `false` | Planning evidence: the validator is already embedded in the governance workflow, so the approved tasks explicitly preserve the current command contract while adding only new fail-closed checks and evidence capture. | — |
| `test-coverage-via-scaffold-replay-path` | `test-integrity` | `addressed` | `planning-time-analysis` | `pending-post-implementation` | T004 and T006-T013 must route proof through `tests/integration/validator-hardening-iteration1.ps1` with assertions on actual user-visible validator output rather than runtime state only. | `true` | Planning evidence: corpus row 6 requires scaffold/replay-path proof for new validator rules, and iteration 001 already assigns that proof to the shared harness plus the rule-specific fixture and reviewer tasks. | — |
| `regression-preservation` | `compatibility` | `addressed` | `planning-time-analysis` | `pending-post-implementation` | T001 must capture the baseline and T009/T013 must re-run `validate-governance.ps1 -ProjectPath .` to prove feature 007 handoff checks, feature 012 readable-reference detection, and existing validator behavior stay intact. | `true` | Planning evidence: iteration 001 changes the central validator surface, so baseline capture and post-implementation revalidation are built into the approved slice to prevent regressions in existing governance checks while the new rules land. | — |

## Pre-Implementation Planning Evidence

### Requirement Traceability

- **Canonical schema rule**: FR-001, FR-005, FR-008, FR-009 via T003-T009
- **Canonical concern rule**: FR-002, FR-005, FR-008, FR-009 via T003-T005 and T010-T013
- **CLI compatibility and additive behavior**: FR-010 via T001, T003, T004, T009, and T013
- **Iteration boundary**: T001-T013 only; approval reuse, over-claim detection, bookkeeping classification, and corpus graduation are deferred to iteration 002

### Stack-Ready Analysis

| Stack Surface | Path | In Scope | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `validator-core` | `extensions/specrew-speckit/scripts/validate-governance.ps1` | Yes | T003, T008, and T012 |
| `validator-shared-helpers` | `extensions/specrew-speckit/scripts/shared-governance.ps1` | Yes | T003, T008, and T012 |
| `contracts` | `specs/013-validator-hardening/contracts/*.md` | Yes | T005 keeps normative references aligned |
| `integration-harness` | `tests/integration/validator-hardening-iteration1.ps1`, `tests/integration/validator-hardening-iteration2.ps1` | Yes | T004 scaffolds shared replay assertions |
| `iteration-1-fixtures` | `tests/integration/fixtures/013-validator-hardening/state-*`, `hardening-gate-*` | Yes | T006, T010 |

## Deferral Note

- Approval-evidence reuse, over-claim enforcement, bookkeeping classification, and corpus graduation are explicitly deferred to iteration 002.
- Post-implementation concern verification is pending because implementation has not been authorized or started.

## Hardening-Gate Status

**Overall Verdict**: ready

**Scope**: Iteration 001 canonical-schema and graceful-error slice (T001-T013) covering canonical iteration metadata enforcement, canonical hardening-gate concern enforcement, structured FAIL output, and iteration-1 replay coverage.

**Post-Implementation Verification Summary**: Pending implementation, review, and closeout evidence.
