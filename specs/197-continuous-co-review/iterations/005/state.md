## Scope (Phase B part 2 — the always-on async navigator)

The deferred high-risk piece: make co-review **auto-fire** at every implement checkpoint as a
pair-programming navigator, registered host-neutrally into the merged F-185 dispatcher, WITHOUT
blocking the Stop hook (the ~20s provider budget; #2885). Delivers FR-026/030/031 +
SC-019/020/021/022's auto-fire half.

Approved design (Iteration 004 decision, 2026-06-23):

1. **Self-limiting watchdog reviewer** — the provider spawns the reviewer wrapped in a watchdog
   that kills it + writes a status/result after N seconds, so it NEVER orphans by construction.
2. **Pending-review registry** — `.specrew/review/pending/<run-id>.json` ({pid, host, checkpoint,
   started_at, deadline, status}).
3. **Reaper** — the next-stop provider + a SessionStart sweep collect results, surface verdicts
   (185's `<<<SPECREW-STOP-BLOCK>>>` if blocking), kill zombies.
4. **Host-agnostic** — registered as a provider in `refocus-scopes.json` (185's dispatcher);
   detached spawn + watchdog via PowerShell 7 cross-platform primitives.

## Carried from Iteration 004

- Non-blocking 145 follow-ups: `TrunkName='main'` default + the F2 nested-key fail-safe.
- SC-012 maintainer real-host smoke test after this auto-fire lands.
