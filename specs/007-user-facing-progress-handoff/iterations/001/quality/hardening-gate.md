## Concern Review

| Concern | Category | Status | Evidence Basis | Runtime Evidence Status | Expected Controls | Blocking | Rationale | Approval |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `security-surface` | `security` | `not-applicable` | `not-applicable` | `not-needed` | — | `false` | Iteration 001 Foundation contains no authentication boundaries, privilege checks, trust domain crossings, or user-controlled paths. It updates coordinator prompt, agent guidance documents, and handoff templates only, with no new runtime code or state transitions. Security surface analysis is not applicable. | — |
| `error-handling-expectations` | `error-handling` | `addressed` | `planning-time-analysis` | `pending-post-implementation` | Coordinator prompt and handoff templates must document graceful handling of edge cases: read-only responses with no artifact work, fully complete factual answers with no follow-up, and verification gaps. T001-T003 planning documents fail-safe guidance; no runtime changes. | `false` | Planning evidence: coordinator prompt (T001) explicitly guides agents to state progress even for read-only answers; handoff template (T002) includes all edge-case patterns; decision guidance (T003) covers verification-gap disclosure. No runtime error paths exist pre-implementation. | — |
| `retry-idempotency-requirements` | `retry-idempotency` | `not-applicable` | `not-applicable` | `not-needed` | — | `false` | Iteration 001 Foundation is purely documentation and prompt guidance. No idempotency concerns apply to coordinator prompt updates, handoff templates, or agent guidance documents. | — |
| `test-integrity-targets` | `test-integrity` | `addressed` | `planning-time-analysis` | `pending-post-implementation` | Planning documents test coverage scope: Iteration 002 (T007-T008) must deliver integration tests under `tests/integration/` that exercise the handoff validator against synthetic governance-jargon responses (must flag) and plain-language responses (must pass). T002 (handoff template) and T006 (soft-validator design) must provide test fixture definitions. | `false` | Planning evidence: T002 handoff template includes edge-case examples for testing; T006 soft-validator design document specifies test scenarios (governance-acronym flag and plain-language pass). Runtime evidence deferred to Iteration 002 when tests land. | — |
| `operational-resilience-concerns` | `operational-resilience` | `addressed` | `planning-time-analysis` | `pending-post-implementation` | Squad.agent.md (T004) must formally codify the three-section handoff format with an explicit session-restart note, and the coordinator prompt, handoff template, and checklist artifacts must remain durable across future updates. | `false` | Planning evidence: T004 explicitly requires the session-restart warning for `.github/agents/squad.agent.md`; T001, T002, and T005 keep the guidance in git-tracked artifacts that can be reviewed and maintained without runtime dependencies. | — |
| `validation-lane-completeness` | `validation` | `addressed` | `planning-time-analysis` | `pending-post-implementation` | Planning documents validation-lane scope: Iteration 002 (T007-T009) must deliver an authorized validation command set for handoff soft-validator coverage. Before Iteration 002 sign-off, validation must confirm the governance-acronym detection rule, plain-language scoring, and edge-case handling (lightweight patterns, fully complete answers, verification gaps, blockers). | `false` | Planning evidence: T006 soft-validator design document specifies the detection rule (three-or-more governance acronyms in lead without plain-language paraphrase) and five core validation scenarios. Runtime evidence deferred to Iteration 002 validation lane. | — |
| `handoff-semantics-correctness` | `specification-compliance` | `addressed` | `planning-time-analysis` | `pending-post-implementation` | Planning documents coordinator prompt, handoff template, and decision guidance must satisfy all three user stories (US1 clear completion, US2 blockers/review needs, US3 lightweight fluency) and map to FR-001 through FR-015. Each artifact must be reviewed by strongest-available class before implementation. | `false` | Planning evidence: T001 coordinator prompt explicitly maps to FR-001–FR-007, FR-012–FR-013; T002 handoff template covers US1, US2, US3 patterns; T003 decision guidance covers FR-008–FR-011. All six tasks traced to spec requirements in the iteration plan. | — |
| `governance-acronym-rule-absorption` | `governance-compliance` | `addressed` | `planning-time-analysis` | `pending-post-implementation` | Planning documents coordinator prompt (T001) and handoff templates (T002) must explicitly absorb the human-handoff trap detection rule (three-or-more governance acronyms in lead without plain-language paraphrase). Agents must understand this constraint during response generation, not discover it only in post-validation. T006 soft-validator design must codify the detection method. | `false` | Planning evidence: T001 coordinator prompt explicitly instructs agents to use plain-language lead and defer governance vocabulary to subsections; T002 handoff template examples demonstrate plain-language-first pattern; T006 soft-validator design formalizes the detection rule. | — |
| `agent-guidance-durability` | `operational-resilience` | `addressed` | `planning-time-analysis` | `pending-post-implementation` | Planning documents agent guidance (T004 Squad.agent.md update) must formally codify the three-section handoff format and include a session-restart note (touching Squad.agent.md requires session restart between iteration close and feature closeout). Guidance must survive future agent updates and be reviewable by strongest-available class. | `false` | Planning evidence: T004 explicitly updates `.github/agents/squad.agent.md` with the formal three-section format and includes the session-restart note. This codification survives across sessions and can be reviewed before implementation. | — |
| `governance-integration-readiness` | `governance-compliance` | `addressed` | `planning-time-analysis` | `pending-post-implementation` | Planning documents governance integration (T005 checklist surface, T006 soft-validator design) must define soft-warning logic, integration points for Iteration 002, and traceability to the known-traps corpus. Soft validator must not hard-block responses but must flag governance-acronym violations and missing handoff fields. | `false` | Planning evidence: T005 governance checklist specifies soft-warning logic and reference to the governance-acronym rule; T006 soft-validator design documents post-response integration and no hard-blocking behavior. Runtime integration is explicitly deferred to Iteration 002. | — |

## Post-Implementation Evidence Notes

- This gate is in the planning-time-analysis state. All concerns carry planning-level evidence and are marked ready pending human review.
- Runtime evidence is explicitly deferred to Iteration 002 when soft-validator implementation and integration tests land.
- The canonical five concerns appear first in the required order, followed by the feature-specific concerns for this documentation-and-governance slice.

## Hardening-Gate Status

**Overall Verdict**: ✅ **READY FOR REVIEW** — All planning artifacts are complete and ready for strongest-available class review before implementation.

**Scope**: Iteration 001 Foundation & Governance (`T001`-`T006`, 10 story_points); soft-validator implementation and integration tests deferred to Iteration 002
