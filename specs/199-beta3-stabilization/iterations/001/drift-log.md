# Drift Log: Iteration 001

**Schema**: v1

<!--
  Markdown authoring note (Specrew lifecycle convention):

  When you add new drift events to this file, watch for MD032 (blanks-around-lists).
  A sentence ending with a colon, immediately followed by a bullet list, is the most
  common violation. Always put a BLANK LINE between the colon line and the list:

      BAD:                              GOOD:
      Resolution steps:                 Resolution steps:
      - Step one                        <— blank line here
      - Step two                        - Step one
                                        - Step two

  The F-033 pre-boundary markdownlint gate runs markdownlint-cli --fix on .md
  changes before every boundary-sync write, so most violations auto-fix — but the
  blank line you write in the first place avoids the cleanup churn.

## Summary

**Total drift events**: 2
**Resolution rate**: 50% (1/2 resolved)
**Specification drift**: None detected (both events are process observations)

## Events

### DRIFT-199-I001-001 — two-message decision stop at the co-design ask (resolved)

- **Observed**: 2026-08-10. The co-design presentation ended the turn without the
  non-boundary context packet; the Stop hook bounced and the packet was rendered in a
  follow-up message — a live instance of the two-message decision-stop pattern that
  FR-017 (one-message decision stops) drives to zero at the instruction layer.
- **Citation**: FR-017; the 208 rule lineage in the beta3 carry ledger (stop-surface
  family, decision-yield composition).
- **Resolution**: human-decision — recorded as evidence for W8's instruction-layer
  work; subsequent decision-yield stops in this session compose packet + ask in one
  message.

### DRIFT-199-I001-002 — pending-verdict stop artifact not emitted at the plan sync (open)

- **Observed**: 2026-08-10T01:15:50Z. The plan boundary sync recorded the crossing
  (`crossing-eb1123ca...`, clarify -> plan, boundary commit d9b1cc85) in
  `.specrew/start-context.json` but `.specrew/runtime/pending-verdict-stop.md` was
  not written; the two earlier syncs (specify, clarify) emitted it. The preceding
  attempts of the same sync halted at the markdownlint pre-boundary gate and at the
  stale-hash guard — sequence possibly relevant. The boundary stop was rendered from
  the recorded `pending_crossing` (controller truth) with the marker taken from its
  from/to values, per the gate-stop skill's artifact-first rule rationale.
- **Citation**: FR-023 (records state facts); gate-stop skill DRIFT-198-I011-012
  lineage (marker must come from controller truth, never phase inference).
- **Resolution**: deferred — routes to the ledger's beta4 list unless it recurs and
  blocks a boundary (scope-closed feature; the crossing record sufficed here).
  **Human instruction (plan verdict, 2026-08-10)**: if it recurs at the tasks
  boundary, diagnose the root cause and record it here before implementation starts —
  diagnosis only; the fix stays deferred to beta4 unless the diagnosis shows it lands
  inside files this feature already touches.

### DRIFT-199-I001-003 — plan sync recorded without iteration identity (resolved)

- **Observed**: 2026-08-10. The first plan boundary sync omitted `-IterationNumber`;
  the crossing recorded with an empty iteration identity, and the Stop-side evidence
  gate refused the boundary stop (stage evidence not locatable in the bound tree) —
  the FR-068-lineage gate behaving as shipped. No verdict was offered against the
  unverifiable state.
- **Citation**: the beta2 release claim's stage-evidence gate; 199 spec FR-023
  (evidence tools verified before trusted).
- **Resolution**: implementation-reverted (process form) — re-synced with
  `-IterationNumber 001`; fresh crossing `crossing-fd27261c` bound to commit
  ffeea775 with the iteration identity present; the stop re-rendered and the plan
  verdict was given over the verifiable state.

### DRIFT-199-I001-005 — F1 (OneDrive) reproduced live on the maintainer's install (open)

- **Observed**: 2026-08-10, running `specrew review --remediate override-block` through the
  INSTALLED module. Exit 1 with
  `review-runtime-managed-file-link-unsupported:C:\Users\alon\OneDrive - Zionet LTD\Documents\PowerShell\Modules\Specrew\0.40.0\scripts\internal\continuous-co-review\_load.ps1`.
- **Significance beyond ledger F1**: the refusal blocked a SANCTIONED REMEDIATION DOOR,
  not merely a campaign run. T067 recorded campaigns being unusable from a OneDrive
  install; this instance shows the disposition/remediation path is equally unreachable,
  so a consumer on the default CurrentUser install cannot even record a governance
  decision. The repo-script path (`pwsh -File scripts/specrew-review.ps1`) is unaffected
  (local volume), which is how work continued.
- **Citation**: FR-011 (reparse-tag discrimination); ledger T067-F1.
- **Resolution**: in scope, covered by task T007 in the harness queue / T006 in tasks.md —
  the reparse-tag work. This instance is added as a second RED reproduction target: the
  remediation door must work from a cloud-placeholder install.

### DRIFT-199-I001-006 — no expressible off-ramp for the pre-code campaign review demand (open)

- **Observed**: 2026-08-10 at the before-implement boundary. The campaign surface goes
  live at `before-implement` by design (worktree-navigator.ps1:158-174, hardened
  2026-08-08 from the testbeta3 dogfood) on the stated premise that "there is
  implementation to review". At that cursor NO implementation exists yet: the block
  `review-required / no-authoritative-campaign-result` demands a review of the PLANNING
  digest.
- **The inexpressible disposition**: the maintainer ruled to decline the pre-code review
  and spend the review budget on the code at review-signoff. The sanctioned instrument
  (`--remediate override-block`) refuses: "Campaign override-block requires --run-id and
  --ack-reason; the disposition is never implicit." Every remediation choice binds to a
  run, and zero runs exist — so "no review is owed at this cursor" has no expressible
  form. The only mechanical exit is to run (and pay for) the review.
- **Relation to the acceptance bar**: this is the F8 family's missing off-ramp
  (fix-everything default with no sanctioned decline) appearing BEFORE any code exists —
  the pattern ledger finding F8 records as the headline failure, and adjacent to the
  sanctioned-quiet-state semantics the maintainer added at the architecture lens (D3).
- **Citation**: FR-007, FR-008 (single-authority stop surface, sanctioned quiet states);
  ledger F8, F5.
- **Resolution**: pending maintainer ruling — recorded as a decision surfaced, not taken.

### DRIFT-199-I001-004 — plan total arithmetic error (resolved, records-only)

- **Observed**: 2026-08-10, at tasks decomposition. plan.md stated "12.1 SP planned"
  while the W1–W13 table sums to 13.1 SP. The approved table itself was correct and
  is unchanged; only the stated total was wrong.
- **Citation**: honest-state rule (count-claims must match artifacts).
- **Resolution**: spec-updated (records-only) — the total line corrected to 13.1 SP
  with the overcommit against the ~10–12 target made visible; surfaced prominently
  at the tasks boundary stop for the maintainer's ruling.

### Resolution Strategies (Unused)

The following resolution strategies remain available if drift is detected later in execution:

- **spec-updated**: Update the spec to reflect implementation choice
- **implementation-reverted**: Revert implementation to match spec
- **deferred**: Mark drift as deferred to next iteration
- **human-decision**: Escalate to Alon for resolution

### Notes

- This artifact was scaffolded before review starts so drift can be logged immediately when detected.
- Replace the zero-drift summary with real counts when the first drift event is recorded.
